# Using the NVIDIA TAO Toolkit with Roboflow

[Use Roboflow to bring custom datasets to the NVIDIA TAO Toolkit](https://blog.roboflow.com/nvidia-tao-toolkit/). The code in this repository 
demonstrates importing a custom dataset, converting it to TFRecords, setting up the necessary
config files, and ultimately training a TAO model using transfer learning.

# What is Roboflow?
## **Roboflow** makes managing, preprocessing, augmenting, and versioning datasets for computer vision seamless. Key features of Roboflow:

- Import and Export image datasets into any supported [formats](https://roboflow.com/formats)
- [Preprocess](https://docs.roboflow.com/image-transformations/image-preprocessing)
  and [augment](https://docs.roboflow.com/image-transformations/image-augmentation) data using Roboflow's dataset
  management tools
- Train computer vision models using [Roboflow Train](https://docs.roboflow.com/train) and deploy
  to [production](https://docs.roboflow.com/inference)
- Use [community curated projects](https://universe.roboflow.com/) to start building your own vision-powered products
